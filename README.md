# measurepy
A python module to boost first-step data analysis after measurements.

## Problem and Motivation

It is very complicated and tedious to deal with data in my physics lab course. Hence, I develop such a package to boost the process. After the first-step analysis, you can turn to complicated and advanced tools or just finish the report if the experiment is simple.

## Features

- Directly get the value and error with multi-measurements.
- Simple linear regession.
- Simple plotting with just a parameter to choose the style.
- Plus, minus, multiply, divide with errors.

## Usage

Currently, the module is WIP. I'm reading and rewriting the codes I wrote in the course.
